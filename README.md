# Mongo Workout App
&nbsp;

## About
---

A web application that makes use of MongoDB & Mongoose in order to store and display user workout information. For this assignment I was given a pre-made Front End interface, and created Express routes and Mongoose Schema in order to make the application functional.

&nbsp;

## Usage
---
The application is deployed at [this link](https://jhworkoutapp.herokuapp.com/).

The first time that you run the application you will have an option to create a new workout. You will be able to select the type of workout and insert workout details. 

&nbsp;

After you submit the workout you will see the stats reflected on the homepage and the stats page.
